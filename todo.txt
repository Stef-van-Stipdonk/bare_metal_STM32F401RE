IN PROGRESS:
6. Setup interrupts

TODO:
7. Setup timers
10. Add architecture specific compilation
14. Setup define macros for gpio registers
17. Setup define macros for rcc registers
18. Setup define macros for nvic registers
19. Setup github action to trigger home lab build
20. Setup github action to HIL testing
21. Setup GTest for testing
22. Setup github action for unit testing
23. Setup RCC clocking abstraction
24. Cleanup the Makefile, it currently leaves behind useless artifacts (tmp.map)

DONE:
1. Update Makefile to support `include/` and `lib/` directories
4. Add memset stub
5. Add memcpy stub
2. Seperate uart.h file into header and implementation files
3. Seperate gpio.h file into header and implementation files
9. Split off hw includes from usage functions of uart
12. Makefile should put obj files into obj/ and bin files into bin/
13. Split off hw includes from usage functions of gpio
15. Split off hw includes from usage functions of rcc
11. Add uart regs macros
16. Split off clocking setup out of main.c
