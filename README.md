## STM32F401RE board bringup
I've never really done any "board bringup".
As in no libraries; just me assembly, C files, some datasheets and probably a cup of coffee.

## Feature list
 - Basic GPIOs
 - RCC
 - Systick timer
 - UART
 - Clock initialization
 - I2C
 - SPI interface for enc28j60 (in progress)
