# Basic questions?
- What is an NVIC for?
Supports 52 different interrupts (not including FPU interrupts).
23 of these can be software interrupts.
Each interrupt can have 16 levels of priority (4 bits).
An interupt can be used to respond to outside "stuff" or events which should cause
the current running thread to be swapped out.

- What is "good" nvic design?
Create the nvic_regs.h which contains the struct + define macros.
For defining the interrupts, define the prototypes in some file like vector_table.h with "weak".
Put a log statement and a "while" trap in these functions.
This way they can be overwritten.
Then put defined IRQ's into an interrupt folder in seperate files for each IRQ.
